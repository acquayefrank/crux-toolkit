Creates a figure that compares the runtime of Crux and Sequest for 
a list of spectra with different mass windows.
Runs Sequest& Crux 3 times with different windows.(0.1, 1, 3)

One issue aobut this figure is that you need to 
copy the index into current directory, so that
run time would be accurately measured.

make sure the crux_parameter settings & index setting and sequest settings are same.

In "runall" make sure to set the 
ms2 file and fasta fiel to the correct files to run.
The fasta file must be in the same directory as the index.

File spectra_random_1000.ms2 is a randomly selected 1000spectra from 
file 090306-20cm-yeast-2h-04.ms2. Has one charge per spectrum
that was randomly selected. Thus, a mix of 1, 2, 3 charged spectrua.
