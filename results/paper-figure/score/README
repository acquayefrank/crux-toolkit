Generates a plot that compares the scoring for Sp and Xcorr between 
Crux and Sequest. Total 6 plots are generated. 

First, randomly select a  peptide among the result peptides from sequest
and compare the scores of SP and Xcorr.
-> 2 plots (Sp, Xcorr)

Second, compares the scores for the top ranked peptide of Sequest.
-> 2 plots (Sp, Xcorr)

Finally, one last plot is generated that shows the distribution of the
score difference of Sp and Xcorr for Crux & Sequest.
-> 2 plots (Sp, Xcorr)

File spectra_random_1000.ms2 is a randomly selected 1000spectra from 
file 090306-20cm-yeast-2h-04.ms2. Has one charge per spectrum
that was randomly selected. Thus, a mix of 1, 2, 3 charged spectrua.
