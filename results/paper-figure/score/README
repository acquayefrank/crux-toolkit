Generates a plot that compares the scoring for Sp and Xcorr between 
Crux and Sequest. Total 6 plots are generated. 
First, randomly select a  peptide among the result peptides from sequest
and compare the scores of SP and Xcorr.
-> 2 plots (Sp, Xcorr)
Second, compares the scores for the top ranked peptide of Sequest.
-> 2 plots (Sp, Xcorr)
Finally, one last plot is generated that shows the distribution of the
score difference of Sp and Xcorr for Crux & Sequest.
-> 2 plots (Sp, Xcorr)
