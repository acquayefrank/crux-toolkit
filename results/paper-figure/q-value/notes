196 p-value vs. 200

onthefly only 50000
percolator segfaulting 
static segfault on e.g. 950 - 960

p-value is not returning all spectra
make sure that SEQUEST does not have inflated results on larger test set
make sure the SEQUEST and crux are being searched against same database with same parameter

onthefly is done
static is done

pvalue is done

percolator is done
