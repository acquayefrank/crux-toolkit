Search many spectra and find those with the same results as sequest.
Search with one dif mod using a small database and no tryptic specificity.
Create new ms2 file with spec that match sequest exactly.
Add that to smoke test.

1. Search spec with crux

./crux create-index --parameter-file mods-crux-params test.fasta test-index
./crux search-for-matches --parameter-file mods-crux-params --sqt-output-file crux-matches-01.sqt 090306-20cm-yeast-2h-01.ms2 test-index


2. Search spec with SEQEUST

# create dtas with ms22dta.pl
# search with sequest
# to date, only file 1 has been used in search
for n in 1 2 3 4; do
 for f in dtas/$n/*; do 
   file=${f##*\/}; 
   ./sequest27 $f > results-sequest/${file/dta/scores}; 
 done
done

3. Compare results

n=1
./compare_best_match.pl results-crux/crux-matches-0$n.sqt results-sequest/$n/090306-20cm-yeast-2h-0$n file-$n

4. Create new ms2 file

# edit script file first
extract-matching-spectra.sh

5. Move new ms2 to smoke dir, research, add results to good_results
