<h1>Crux calibration tests</h1>

<p>
In this test, we measure the extent to which the p-values generated by
Tide are uniformly distributed for scores drawn according to the null
hypothesis.  We use as a null model scores generated by searching real
spectra against shuffled protein sequences.  Uniformity of the
p-values is visualized by plotting a histogram and a quantile-quantile
(QQ) plot of the p-value distribution.  A perfect histogram will be
uniform in the interval [0,1].  A perfect QQ will follow the line y=x.
We plot the QQ plot on a log scale, and include lines corresponding to
y=2x and y=0.5x.  Ideally, the statistic will stay within these
boundaries over multiple orders of magnitude.  The plots are produced
both for the targets (which should not give uniform p-values) and the
decoys (which are re-shuffled peptides from within the shuffled
proteins).</p>
