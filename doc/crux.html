<blockquote>
In proteomics, the large-scale study of protein function and
structure, one of the major challenges is to identify the proteins
that are expressed in cells at different conditions. Mass spectrometry
is a widely used method for protein identification; however, a detailed
spectrum analysis is required to match the spectrum to the source
protein. Crux contains software for tandem mass spectrometry analysis,
with a focus on peptide identification.

<p>
The core programs in the Crux toolkit are</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="match-search.html">match-search</a></li>

<li>
<a href="match-analysis.html">match-analysis</a></li>

</ul>

<p>
In addition, Crux contains the following utilities:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="match-search.html">match-search</a> Given as input an ms2 file,
a spectrum scan number within that file, a sequence database, and an
optional parameter file, search the spectrum against the peptides in the
sequence database, and return high scoring peptides (replaces search-spectra).

<li>
<a href="match-analysis.html">match-analysis</a> 
Given as input a sequence database and PSMs generate additional run specific
features and analyze with a user specified algorithm (e.g. Percolator).

<li>
<a href="predict-peptide-ions.html">predict-peptide-ions</a> Given a peptide and a charge state, predict the ions according to the provided options.

<li>
<a href="get-ms2-spectrum.html">get-ms2-spectrum</a> Using a binary search, extract an MS-MS spectrum with a particular scan number from a .ms2 file, and output the spectrum. Optionally output some summary statistics for the MS-MS spectrum.</li>

<li>
<a href="predict-peptide-ions.html">predict-peptide-ions</a> Given a peptide and a charge state, predict the ions according to the provided options.</li>

<li>
<a href="score-peptide-list-spectrum.html">score-peptide-list-spectrum</a> Score a spectrum against a peptide list(peptides with charge), using the information in param and the specified scoring type.</li>

<li>
<a
href="score-peptide-spectrum.html">score-peptide-spectrum</a> Score a spectrum against a single peptide, using the information in param and the specified scoring type.</li>

<li>
<a
href="search-spectrum.html">search-spectrum</a> Given as input an ms2 file, a spectrum scan number within that file, a sequence database, and an optional parameter file, search the spectrum against the peptides in the sequence database, and return high scoring peptides.</li>

<li>
<a
href="search-spectra.html">search-spectra</a> Given as input an ms2 file, a sequence database, and an optional parameter file, search all the spectrum against the peptides in the sequence database, and return high scoring peptides.</li>

<li>
<a
href="spectacle.html">spectacle</a> Create an image file of an
annotated spectrum.</li>

</ul>

<p>The current version of Crux is 1.0</p>

<p>Crux is written in ANSI C for Unix/Linux platforms.</p>

<p>The Crux software was written by Chris Park and Aaron Klammer under
the supervision of <a
href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/~noble">Prof. William Stafford
Noble</a> in the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of
Washington, Seattle.</p>
