<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Crux tandem mass spectrometry analysis software</H1>

<p>
In proteomics, the large-scale study of protein function and
structure, one of the major challenges is to identify the proteins
that are expressed in cells at different conditions. Mass spectrometry
is a widely used method for protein identification; however, a detailed
spectrum analysis is required to match the spectrum to the source
protein. Crux contains software for tandem mass spectrometry analysis,
with a focus on peptide identification.</p>

<p>
The core programs in the Crux toolkit are</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="match-search.html">match-search</a>: Search a collection of
spectra against a sequence database, returning a collection of
peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs).</li>

<li>
<a href="match-analysis.html">match-analysis</a>: Analyze a collection
of PSMs using Percolator.</li>

</ul>

<p>
In addition, Crux contains the following utilities:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="match-search.html">match-search</a> Given as input an ms2
file, a spectrum scan number within that file, a sequence database,
and an optional parameter file, search the spectrum against the
peptides in the sequence database, and return high scoring peptides
(replaces search-spectra).</li>

<li>
<a href="predict-peptide-ions.html">predict-peptide-ions</a> Given a peptide and a charge state, predict the ions according to the provided options.

<li>
<a href="get-ms2-spectrum.html">get-ms2-spectrum</a> Extract an MS-MS
spectrum with a specified scan number from a <code>.ms2</code>
file.</li>

<li>
<a href="score-peptide-spectrum.html">score-peptide-spectrum</a> Score
a single spectrum against a single peptide.</li>

<li>
<a
href="score-peptide-list-spectrum.html">score-peptide-list-spectrum</a>
Score a single spectrum against a given list of peptides.</li>

<li>
<a href="search-spectrum.html">search-spectrum</a> Score a single
spectrum against a given sequence database.</li>

<li>
<a href="search-spectra.html">search-spectra</a> Score a collection of
spectra against a sequence database and return high scoring
peptides.</li>

<li>
<a
href="spectacle.html">spectacle</a> Create an image file of an
annotated spectrum.</li>

</ul>

<p>The current version of Crux is 1.0</p>

<p>Crux is written in ANSI C for Unix/Linux platforms.</p>

<p>The Crux software was written by Chris Park and Aaron Klammer under
the supervision of <a

Noble</a> in the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of
Washington, Seattle.</p>
