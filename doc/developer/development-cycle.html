<h1>The change-review-commit cycle</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
If you are reading this document, you may be new to the crux
development team.  Welcome!  The following is an outline of a typical
work cycle.  If you are a seasoned programmer, it will give you an
idea of how we combine our versioning system (Git) with
our code review process.  However, it is written with the junior
developer in mind with useful tips for folks who may not be accustomed
to working on a multi-person project.  The outline is also 
sprinkled with links to more details of the various components of the
process.  We strive to keep our documentation current and complete.
If you find something unclear or out-of-date, don't hesitate to update
this page or others.

<h2>Prepare your working copy</h2>

<li>
To begin work on crux, you will need a copy of the code base.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">Clone</a> a clean  
copy from the
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit">GitHub repository</a>
or update your existing
working copy.  For most changes it is highly recommended to create 
a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository">branch</a> and a pull 
request in GitHub repository for any non-trivial changes. After your work is complete you can merge your changes 
into master after a code review. Suggested branch naming template is {branch creator}_{brief description}.
<li>
Run 
<pre><code>
    git fetch --all
    git checkout {your branch name}
    git pull</code> </pre>
      to make sure you are making changes in your branch, not in master.

<li>
<a href="using-cmake.html">Build</a> crux and run the 
<a href="crux-tests.html">tests</a> to make sure everything is working
before you start.

<h2>Implement your changes</h2>
<li>
This is the part you already know how to do.  Edit or add files.
Build and test frequently. There is no preferred IDE for Crux on Linux, so feel free to use your favorite IDE, as long
as it supports CMake. On Windows Crux is built using MS Visual Studio.<br/>
Consider adding new <a href="crux-tests.html">smoke or unit tests</a> for your new
functionality or bug-fix.  Remember to follow the 
<a href="crux-coding-standards.html">coding standards</a>.

<h2>Prepare for your code review</h2>
<li>
When you are ready for a <a href="code-review.html">code review</a>, do a
final build and test to see that everything is working.

<li>
Run <code>git status</code> to see the list of files that changed and
to confirm that you added any new files to Git. Use <code>git diff -b</code>
to review your changes before commit.

<li>
    After you reviewed your changes perform a local commit using 
    <code>git commit -m"Your commit message"</code>. It is a good practice to always provide
    an informative message with every commit, even when you are on your own branch or fork.
</li>

<li>
Run <code>git pull</code> to obtain any changes in the upstream repository.
If necessary, run <code>git merge</code>, resolve conflicts, build, and test.

<li>
    Run <code>git push</code> to publish your changes to your remote branch on GitHub.
    Now you can go to GitHub and create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests">pull request</a> 
    for your branch. The pull request is a good place
    to provide a more detailed description of your changes and request a code review.
</li>

<li>
Make any changes suggested by your reviewer.  Build, test, commit and 
push your changes, repeating the cycle until you and your reviewer
have agreed on the set of changes.

<h2>Merge your changes</h2>
<li>
Merge your pull request into master using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request">Squash and Merge</a>.
Make sure you reviewed the commit message before the merge and make it short and concise, 
especially if your pull request has multiple commits.<br/>
Since the automated Crux bild is done on the master branch only it is a good practice to monitor the 
TeamCity build after your merge to make sure you did not break anything.<br/>
To avoid breaking the main build it is a good idea to merge master into your branch and do another 
round of building and testing before the merge to make sure somebody else's changes do not interfere with yours.
Please delete your branch from the GitHub repository when you are sure your merge is successful.

<h2>Notes on branches</h2>
<p>
 In a branch, the code need not
be fully functional when it is reviewed.  For example, if you are
creating a new class, the first review may be just of the header file
defining the new class.  It's more important that your reviewer be
given manageable amounts of change than that you finish everything
before someone sees it.
</p>

<h2>Notes on simultaneous changes</h2>
<p>
You may have several small projects you are working on at once which
you want to be reviewed separately.  Since Git branches are cheap and easy to create,
it is almost always better and less error prone to have separate branches
than to make concurrent changes in your workspace and then carve out two separate commits.<br/>
Also, if your changes involve only Crux code (not build scripts or external dependencies patches)
it is possible to switch between branches within same workspace without a full rebuild.
  For example, if you are writing some helper
functions in crux-utils.cpp to be used later, you could do 
<pre><code>
    git checkout master
    git pull            #makes sure you are on the most recent master branch
    git checkout -b genius_cruxUtilsFix     #creates a new branch from master and checks it out
</code></pre>
to create a local branch, do some changes there, then do a (local) commit and create another 
local branch for some cool stuff you came up with and do some work there. You can keep working and switching between the
two branches locally until you think one or both of them are ready for the review. At that point you do
<code>git push -u origin genius_cruxUtilsFix</code> which publishes your local branch to the GitHub repository,
then go there, create a pull request and request a review.
