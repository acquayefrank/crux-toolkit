<h2>Managing the Crux Sourceforge Project</h2>
We use
<a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a>
to host the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cruxtoolkit">Crux SVN repository</a>
and the 
<a href="http://cruxtoolkit.sourceforge.net">Crux website</a>.
Kaipo Tamura, Charles Grant, and Bill Noble are the administrators for the project.
We also have a utility account with the user name <code>crux-toolkit</code>.
The utility account is used by our 
<a href="crux-team-city.html">TeamCity server</a>
to upload files to the web site.
Contact Charles for the password for this account.

<h2>Granting Shell Access Permisions to a User for a Project</h2>

It can occasionally be useful to open an interactive shell session 
with access to the Crux files on the Sourceforge servers.
Only users listed as 'Release Technicians' for the project are
allowed shell access to the project files.
<p/>
To add a user to the list of 'Release Technicians',
<ol>
<li>
Go to the Sourceforge page for the project:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cruxtoolkit">Crux Sourceforge</a>,
</li>
<li>
Click on the "Admin" link, in the menu bar under the project title.
</li>
<li>
Click on the "Tools" button on the left side of the page.
</li>
<li>
Click on the "Release Technicians" link
 under the "File" button in the "Tools" section.
</li>
<li>
Check the accounts that should be made "Release Technicians".
Notice that accounts with administrative privileges are always "Release
Technicians"
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Starting an SSH connection to a shell on Sourceforge</h2>
The general syntax for starting a Sourceforge shell with access to the project
files is:
<pre>
ssh -t USER,PROJECT@shell.sourceforge.net create
</pre>
In the case of user <code>charlesegrant</code> connecting to project <code>Crux-Toolkit</code>
this becomes:
<pre>
ssh -t charlesegrant,cruxtoolkit@shell.sourceforge.net create
</pre>
Sourceforge only uses lower case letters,
and doesn't allow the character '-' in project directory names,
so although the official name of the project is <code>Crux-Toolkit</code>,
the project directory name is <code>cruxtoolkit</code>.
The character '-' <b>is</b> allowed in user names,
so the command to start a shell session for the user <code>crux-toolkit</code>
with permission to access the project files for <code>Crux-Toolkit</code> is
<pre>
ssh -t crux-toolkit,cruxtoolkit@shell.sourceforge.net create
</pre>
After you've logged on, you'll be in your home directory.

<h2>Backing up the Sourceforge SVN repository</h2>
Sourceforge is susceptible to outages, and it's future is somewhat uncertain.
Backups of the code repository and web site should be made periodically.
The command to make a local copy of the Crux SVN repository is:
<pre>
rsync -av svn.code.sf.net::p/cruxtoolkit/ .
</pre>
The backup copy is currently stored in
<code>/net/noble/vol1/home/cegrant/sourceforge-backup</code>
<h2>Crux-Toolkit Web Site</h2>
The Sourceforge web services for projects are described
<a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Project%20Web%20and%20Developer%20Web/#php-script-support">here</a>.
The directory containing the Crux-Toolkit project files is:
<code>/home/project-web/cruxtoolkit/htdocs/</code>.
<p/>
Sourceforge no longer provides log files for the Crux web site.
Our <code>doc/user/downbload/download.php</code> script
does log downloads of the Crux distributions.
The distrubution download log can be downloaded via <code>scp</code>:
<pre>
scp -r  crux-toolkit@web.sourceforge.net:/home/project-web/cruxtoolkit/htdocs/download/downloads.txt .
</pre>
<p/>
<h2>Interactions Between Crux-Toolkit Site on Sourceforge and Our TeamCity Server</h2>
Our TeamCity server runs two scripts that interact with the Crux-Toolkit on Sourceforge.
<ul>
<li>
The "Deploy documentation to website" script uses the <code>crux-toolkit</code>
account to copy files from <code>src/user</code> in the source tree to the root
of the Crux-Tookit web site on Sourceforge.
This script runs early every morning when there has been a change to the SVN
repository.
</li>
<li>
The "Deploy successful build to website" script uses the <code>crux-toolkit</code>
account to copy the binary and source packages generated as TeamCity artifacts
in a successful build to the <code>download/daily</code> subdirectory of the
Crux-Toolkit website.
This script runs early every morning when there has been a change to the SVN repository,
but it will only update the distribution files if Crux has built successfully
on 64-bit Linux, 32-bit Linux, OS X, and Windows.
</li>
<li>
The "Generate crux-toolkit website statistics" script uses the <code>crux-toolkit</code>
account to download and analyze
<a href="http://cruxtoolkit.sourceforge.net">Crux Toolkit website</a>
access logs, as described above.
A
<a href="http://cruxtoolkit.sourceforge.net/crux-web-report.html">
static page with the summary of the analysis
</a>
is uploaded back to the web side.
</li>
</ul>
