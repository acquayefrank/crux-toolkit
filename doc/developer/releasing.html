 <h2 align=center>Notes on releasing new versions of Crux</h2>

<p><i>Note: A detailed <a href=#todo>checklist</a> is at the bottom of
    this page</i>

<h3>Before you begin</h3>
<p>Confirm that a clean check out builds correctly and passes all the
  smoke and unit tests. Update the release notes
  (crux/doc/user/release-notes.html).  At the very least, the date
  will need to be added. Update index.html in doc/user/downloads
  to point to the new version and to include links to the previous version.
  You can also make sure that the default.params file is up-to-date by running
  write-default-params.sh in crux/src/c.

<h3>Branching</h3>
<p>The first release of crux, version 1.0, was given its own development
branch named <code>rel-1-0</code> in the SVN repository.  Bugs
reported by users were fixed in this branch and builds from this
branch were made available for download. Changes made to this branch
are periodically merged into the trunk. The next release should
be given its own branch at which point work in <code>rel-1-0</code>
will cease and that directory can be deleted.</p>

<h3>Version numbers</h3>
<p>Each time new files are made available for download, the version
number should increment by 0.01 for minor releases or by 0.1 for major
releases. The version number is maintained in CMakeLists.txt in the
root Crux directory in the lines
<pre>
set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "X")
set (CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "XX")
</pre>
This controls the numbering of packages and what is reported by the 
<code>--version</code> option.
</p>

<h3>Building packages</h3>
<p>Avoid building packages in the root.
Create a sub-directory in the root for the relase type (source, 32-bit
Linux, 64-bit Linux, Darwin).
Move into the sub-directory and run
<pre>
cmake ..
</pre>
</p>
<p>There are two targets for building packages.  
The command <code>make package_source</code> will create a tarred and zipped file
containing source code and documentation.
The command <code>make package</code> will create a zipped file containing 
the compiled binaries for all of the crux tools and the documentation.  
The binary package file will include the
computer architecture and operating system in the name so that builds
on multiple computers can be easily distinguished.</p>

<p>After building the packages, run <code>make checksum</code>.  Do
this for each bdist package built.  A new file with the output of the
checksum is created for each package and will be included on the
download page.</p>

<p>The distribution files are no longer being stored in SVN. However,
putting the files in <code>crux/doc/user/downloads</code> will
facilitate the website update step.  Detailed notes about changes made can be
recorded in <code>crux/ChangeLog</code>.  A more general description of changes
(aimed at the user) should be recorded in
<code>crux/doc/user/download/release-notes.html</code></p> 

<h3>Updating the website</h3>
<p>The public crux website is at
 <code>/var/noble/www/htdocs/proj/crux</code>
 and its address is http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/crux/.  The
<code>proj/crux/</code> directory should contain all of the files and
 sub-directories of <code>crux/doc/user/</code>.  The the target
 <code>webpage</code> in <code>crux/doc/user</code> will copy all
 necessary files to the web directory. The login/password
 for the downloads page is <code>crux</code> and <code>warm.Brandy</code>.

<h3>Checklist</h3></a>
<p>Here is a list of steps to follow, roughly in this order</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a release branch.
<li>Do a clean checkout of the release branch.
<h4>Update documentation</h4>
<li>Change version number in <code>crux/CMakeLists.txt</code>.
<li>Look at the SVN log since the last release and update release
  notes accordingly.
<li>Change the <code>crux/doc/user/download/index.html</code> page.
<h4>Build and test</h4>
<li>Build.
<li>Check unit and smoke tests.
<li>Check version number with <code>crux version</code>.
<li>Commit changes.
<h4>Create files for distribution</h4>
<li>Create packages
  <ul> 
    <li><code>cmake ..</code>
    <li><code>make package_source</code>
    <li><code>make package</code>
    <li><code>make checksum</code>
  </ul>
You should now have these files:
  <ul>
   <li>crux_1.xx.tar.gz
   <li>crux_1.xx.tar.gz.md5sum.txt
   <li>crux_1.xx-PLATFORM.zip
   <li>crux_1.xx-PLATFORM.zip.md5sum.txt
  </ul>

<li>Repeat the build and package steps for remaining platforms.  Note
  that you do not need to package up the source files again.
<h4>Check the distribution files</h4>
<li>Unpack and build the source file tarballs.
<li>Unpack and run the binary files.  <i>You may want to ask someone
    else to do these steps on different computers.</i>
<h4>Update the website</h4>
<li>Move the distribution files to <code>crux/doc/user/download</code>
and <code>crux/doc/user/open_source_download</code>.
<li>Copy the documentation and distribution files to the website with
<code>make webpage</code> from <code>crux/doc/user</code>.
<li>Test that the links all work.
<li>Send a message to the crux users list announcing the new release.
</ol>
