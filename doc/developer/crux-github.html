<h2>Managing the Crux GitHub Project</h2>
We use
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
to host the
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit">Crux repository</a>
and the 
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit.github.io">Crux website repository</a>.
Note that the Crux website repository is automatically updated with content from the 
<code>doc/user</code> directory of the <code>Crux repository</code> as part of the Crux GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">build action</a>.
You generally shouldn't need to commit anything directly into the Crux website repository.
<p/>
We used to use TeamCity as our build system.
This has been replaced by a <a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">GitHub Action</a> that automatically runs whenever a commit is made to the <code>master</code>
branch of the Crux repository.
Any other branch of the Crux repository that contains <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code>
can also run the build action manually using the GitHub website.
One the GitHub website: 
<ol>
<li>Go to the Crux repository. 
<li>Choose the branch you wish to work with.
<li>Go to "Actions" for the repository.
<li>In the left sidebar click on the "build-crux-distributions-workflow".
<li>Click on the "Run workflow" button.
</ol>
Note: the Crux website and release distributions will not be updated when the build action is run
on non-master branches.


<p/>
Kaipo Tamura, Charles Grant, and Bill Noble are the maintainers for the project.
Contact one of them to be added as a developer on the project.
We have a utility GitHub account with the user name <code>cruxtoolkit</code>.
Contact Charles for the password for this account.
