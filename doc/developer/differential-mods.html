Differential Mods
Author: Aaron Klammer
2008-Mar-14

Here is a list of requirements for the implementation of differential modifications in Crux: 
<ul>
<li> Differential modifications will be specified in the parameter file by triplets:
<ul>
<li> A mass offset (float)
<li> A list of amino acids where the modification can occur (string)
<li> A maximum number of modifications per peptide (int)
</ul>
<li> A single amino acid may have multiple modifications of different types, but only one of the same type.
<li> A single analysis may have at most 11 different kinds of modifications.
<li> N-term and C-term modifications will be allowed.
<li> Some N-term mods will only be allowed on peptides with an N-term
within a parameter controlled distance of the protein N-term.
<li> To avoid exponential explosion, there will be a maximum number of
modified peptides generated from any particular unmodified peptide (e.g.
1000).
</ul>
