Here is a list of requirements for the implementation of differential modifications in Crux: 
<ul>
<li> Differential modification types will be specified in the parameter file by triplets:
<ul>
<li> A mass offset (float)
<li> A list of amino acids where the modification can occur (string)
<li> A maximum number of this type of modification per peptide (int)
</ul>
<li> A single amino acid may have multiple modifications of different types, but only one of the same type.
<li> A single analysis will allow at most 11 different types of modifications.
<li> Peptide N-term and C-term modifications will be allowed. The
constraints will be the same as for internal amino acids, i.e. multiple
modifications of different types will be allowed, but only one modification
of the same type.
<li> Protein N-term and C-term modifications will be allowed. Again, constraints
on number and type of modification will be the same as for internal amino
acids.
<li> Some N-term mods will only be allowed on peptides with an N-term
within a parameter controlled distance of the protein N-term.
<li> To avoid exponential explosion, there will be a maximum number of modified peptides generated from any unmodified peptide (e.g.  1000).
Modifications will be enumerated from lowest number of total modifications
per peptide to highest. The enumeration of modified peptides for 
an unmodified peptide will stop if the next largest number
of modifications will push the total number of modified peptides
above the maximum value.
<li> A potential efficiency in enumerating peptides can be gained by scoring
low modification peptides first and only proceeding to high modification
peptides if the low modification scores are below some threshold.
This will be implemented after the core differential modification functionality. 

</ul>
