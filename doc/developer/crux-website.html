<h2>Managing the Crux Web Site</h2>
The 
<a href="http://crux.ms">Crux web site</a> 
(<code>https://crux.ms</code>)
is hosted on GitHub 
using the GitHub <a href="https://pages.github.com">Pages</a> facility.
The <code>crux.ms</code> domain name is registered by Charles with
<a href="http://networksolutions.com">Network Soluions</a>.
Talk to Charles if you need changes or have questions.
<p/>
The source for the Crux web site is kept in the <code>doc/user</code> sub-directory
of the <a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit">Crux repository</a> 
(<code>https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit</code>).
The <a href="https://pages.github.com">Pages</a> facility is unable to
root the site in a sub-directory, so the web site is published from a separate 
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit.github.io">Crux web site repository</a>
(<code>https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit.github.io</code></code>)
which contains only the <code>user/doc</code> tree from the main repository. 
Whenever the master branch of the Crux repository is updated, 
a 
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">GitHub action</a> 
performs a build on all platforms,
and tests the Centos7 build to make sure the smoke test pass.
If all platforms build, and the smoke tests pass, all the files
under <code>doc/user</code> will be copied from the 
Crux repository to the Crux web site repository.
An additional file, 
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit.github.io/blob/master/latest-build.txt"><code>latest-build.txt</code></a>,
will be updated with the short version of the Git hash for the succesful commit.
The <a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml">GitHub action</a> 
makes use of a 
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/settings/secrets/actions">secret named DOC_UPDATE_KEY</a> 
associated with the  Crux repository.
The secret has to contain a personal access token, generated with rights to read the repository and run actions.
Currently this token is provided by Charles.
<p/>
Downloadable releases of
the Crux software are stored separately, on the 
<a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/crux-downloads">Noble lab web server</a>
(<code>http://noble.gs.washington.edu/crux-downloads</code>). 
The Noble lab web server is hosted on <code>noble-web</code>.
Major releases are stored in 
<code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads</code>. 
Intermediate releases are stored in
<code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code>. 
On the <a href="http://crux.ms/download.html">Crux download page</a>
the two download buttons will post to a
<a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/doc/user/download/download.php"i>PHP script</a>.
This PHP script is hosted on the 
<a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/crux-downloads">Noble lab web server</a>
in <code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code>. 
It reads the the short version of the Git hash for the latest succesful build
from the file <code>latest-build.txt</code>.
.
<p/>
The script <a href="https://github.com/crux-toolkit/crux-toolkit/blob/master/scripts/download-latest-crux-artifact.sh">
<code>scripts/download-latest-crux-artifact.sh</code>
</a>
checks the Crux repository and if a new build has been successful, 
copies the distribution artifacts from the Crux Repository
to <code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code>. 
The existence of a new build is checked by downloading a copy of <code>latest-build.txt</code> from the Crux web repository, 
and comparing its contents to the copy in <code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code> on <code>noble-web</code>.
The <a href="https://cli.github.com">gh command line tool</a> is used 
to download the artifacts for the latest successful build which are then copied to
<code>/noble/www/htdocs/crux-downloads/daily</code>.

This script is invoked once an hour by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron"><code>cron job</code></a>.
The <code>cron job</code> is currently controled by Charles.

<h2>Google Analytics</h2>

<p>
Crux uses Google Analytics to track user commands. A summary of these
counts are updated regularly to the main Crux web page. To see
details, go to
the <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google
Analytics page</a>, making sure you use the correct Google account. In
the menu on the left select Customisation/Custom Reports and click on
the Usage by App report link. This brings you to the crux commands
report. There is a date interval selection control in the upper-right
corner. The table with the commands breakdown has totals in the header
row.</p>
