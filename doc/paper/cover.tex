\opening{Dear Editor:}

We are submitting a manuscript entitled ``Unsupervised segmentation of
continuous genomic data'' for consideration for publication as an
Applications Note in {\em Bioinformatics}.

The note describes a software tool that uses a combination of wavelet
analyses and hidden Markov models to perform unsupervised segmentation
of genomic data.  We developed the tool in the context of the NIH
ENCODE consortium.  Our ENCODE colleagues and we have found the tool
to be very useful for interpreting high-throughput data sets, and we
believe that others will find it useful as well.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
