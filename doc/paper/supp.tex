  The figure plots, for a collection of randomly generated spectra and
  randomly associated peptides 
  $Sp$ (A) and $XCorr$ (B) scores as computed by Crux as a function of the
  same scores as computed by {\sc Sequest}. These spectra should cover
  spectra from all possible fragmentation technologies, including
  MALDI-TOF/TOF and QTOF.
