  The figure plots, for a collection of MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra (top, {\sf A}
  and {\sf B}) and QTOF spectra (bottom, {\sc C} and {\sc D}) scored against 
  randomly associated peptides using $Sp$ (left, {\sf A} and {\sf C}) and 
  $XCorr$ (right, {\sf B} and {\sf D}) 
  as computed by Crux as a function of the
  same scores as computed by {\sc Sequest}. The spectra obtained 
  are 1000 spectra randomly sampled from the 4800 and QStar data sets
  publicly available at 
  http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jprobs/2008/7/i01/abs/pr070244j.html

  \caption{{\bf Rapid retrieval of candidate peptides.}  The figure
  plots the total running time required to search 100 tandem mass
  spectra against the yeast protein databases
  on computers running the Linux ({\sf A}) 
  or Windows ({\sf B}) operating systems, using {\sc Sequest} and Crux with 
  and without indices.
  Run time is plotted 
  as a function of the mass tolerance used to define candidate
  peptides. The Linux OS plots have three series
  because indexed {\sc Sequest} searches with are only possible on Windows.
