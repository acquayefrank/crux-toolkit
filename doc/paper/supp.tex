  The figure plots, for a collection of randomly generated spectra and
  randomly associated peptides 
  $Sp$ ({\sf A}) and $XCorr$ ({\sf B}) scores as computed by Crux as a function of the
  same scores as computed by {\sc Sequest}.

  \caption{{\bf Rapid retrieval of candidate peptides.}  The figure
  plots the total running time required to search 100 tandem mass
  spectra against the yeast protein databases
  on computers running the Linux ({\sf A}) 
  or Windows ({\sf B}) operating systems, using {\sc Sequest} and Crux with 
  and without indices.
  Run time is plotted 
  as a function of the mass tolerance used to define candidate
  peptides. The Linux OS plots have three series
  because indexed {\sc Sequest} searches with are only possible on Windows.
