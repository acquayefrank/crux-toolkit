- all executable options (--option) should have dashes rather than underscores
- the crux index info file should have text (e.g. for peptide type) rather than numbers
  in general, it should be human interpretable. if you'd like to have another separate file that is
  more machine interpretable, that's fine too.
- executables that use an index should default to the parameter values in the index, 
  unless a parameter in the parameter file or on the command line contradicts the index parameters,
  in which case it should error out
- it looks get_ms2_spectrum prints a line "Filename:test.ms2" to the beginning
  of the output. If it does, it shouldn't.
