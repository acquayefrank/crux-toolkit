                To explore using retention time-related quantities 
                for use in peptide sequence database indexing.

                Retention time can be used to reduce the
                number of candidate peptides that must be examined for a
                given spectrum in a given mass window. 
                Certain peptides are not expected to elute at certain
                retention times; for example, in a typical reverse phase
                experiment, very hydrophilic
                peptides should elute early and very hydrophobic peptides
                should elute late. Put another way, peptides of similar 
                hydrophobicity should elute at roughly the same time. 
              <br><br>
                Thus,
                given a measure of hydrophobicity, 
                and a peptide that is known to elute 
                at a particular time (the bait),
                one should be able to exclude from search those peptides 
                that should not elute near that time, i.e., peptides that are
                greater than some distance 
                in hydrophobicity from the bait peptide.
              <br><br>
              To test this hypothesis, I ran the following experiment:
              
              Start with a set of known PSMs from a single RP run. 
              Sort the PSMs by retention time (i.e. scan number) and iterate
              through each PSM. For each PSM calculate the hydrophobic 
              distance between
              that PSM's peptide (the bait) and the next PSM's peptide (the
              prey). Call this distance the score for a TP PSM. Now, calculate
              the distance between the bait and all candidate peptides in
              the same mass window as the prey PSM. Call these distances the
              scores for FP PSMs. 
              Now plot an ROC relating TP to RP hydrophobic distance scores. 
              A point on the ROC will reflect the fraction
              of TP peptide IDs that we can hope to maintain at a given
              hydrophobic distance threshold while excluding a given
              fraction of FP candidate peptides.
              <br><br>
              Perform this experiment for a couple of different measures of
              hydrophobic distance, shown below:

                For the best distance method (*two) we can maintain 90% of
                our TP ids while eliminating 50% of the FP (candidate
                peptides), for an estimated 2-fold decrease in analysis time.
                Of course this is not cross-validated, but still is a
                promising result, given that it is as good as charge-czar,
                without really trying that hard.
