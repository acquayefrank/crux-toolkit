Crux and Percolator integration

The Percolator/Crux integration is done under the same method described of 
C/C++ integration written in "c_cpp_integration" under crux/doc. Crux is 
written in C, while Percolator is written in C++ using modules from the 
Standard C++ library, thus there is some extra measure required to merge 
the two applications together. 

First, the user must check out both Crux and Percolator projects from CVS 
repository. There are not bundled together in CVS to allow independent 
further development on both applications.

Second, to compile the application, the makefile under crux/src controls
all subsequent actions needed to compile both Percolator and Crux. Thus, 
the user should only have to type make once with Crux's makefile. 

In detail, the Crux's makefile calls Percolator's makefile to compile the 
Percolator's C++ portion of the code into a library file called 
"libpercolator.a". Once finished, the Crux C code is compiled linked with 
the Percolator library "libpercolator.a" and the standard C++ library by 
the "-lstdc++" flag. One complication, under the current setup is the 
percolator C interface file location. All Crux routines that use Percolator 
must call routines through the percolator C interface, thus must include 
PercolatorCInterface.h file. However, the PercolatorCInterface.h file is 
located in Percolator src directory and not in the Crux src directory. 
The current solution is for the Crux makefile to copy over the 
PercolatorCInterface.h  file from the Percolator src directory before 
compilation.
