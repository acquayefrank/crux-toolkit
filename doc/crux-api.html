<ul>

<li>
<b>amino_acid</b>: A single amino acid, with three properties: type,
mass and a list of chemical modifications.

<li>
<b>chemical_modification</b>: A modification to an amino acid.  It has
two properties: name (e.g., acetylation, water-loss, etc.) and mass
offset.

<li>
<b>peptide</b>: A string of amino acids, with properties such as
length, charge (possibly "unknown"), mass, and mass-to-charge.  The
function <code>get_proteins</code> returns a list of proteins in which
the peptide occurs.

<li>
<b>protein</b>: A longer string of amino acids, plus a collection of
peptides, with indices indicating where each peptide occurs in the
protein.

<li>
<b>database</b>: An unordered set of peptides.  The primary function
is <code>read_database</code>, which reads the database from a given
input file.

<li>
<b>database_enumerator</b>: An enumeration object for traversing the
peptides in a database.  This object may enumerate only the peptides
within a specified mass-to-charge range.

<li>
<b>fragment</b>: A fragment of a peptide, with a pointer to the
originating peptide.  The fragment has five properties: ion series (b
or y), cleavage location, charge, a list of chemical modifications,
and isotope offset (in Daltons).

<li>
<b>peak</b>: A single peak in a mass spectrum, with two properties:
mass-to-charge and intensity.  The peak also has a (possibly empty)
list of associated fragments.

<li>
<b>spectrum</b>: A collection of peaks.

<li>
<b>spectrum_enumerator</b>: An enumeration object for traversing the
peaks in a spectrum.

<li>
<b>peptide_spectrum_match</b>: A spectrum and an associated peptide.

<li>
<b>psm_score_function</b>: A generic scoring routine for
peptide_spectrum_matches.  Takes as input (1) a SCORE_FUNCTION_T
object that specifies the type of score function to be applied, and
(2) a single peptide_spectrum_match.  Returns a numeric score.
