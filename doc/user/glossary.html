  <h2>Mass spectrometry terminology</h2>

  <ul>

    <li><b>c-term peptide</b>: The last peptide in the protein,
      occurring at the c-terminal end of the protein.</li>
    
    <li><b>decoy peptide</b>: A shuffled, reversed or randomly
      generated peptide sequence. Matches to decoy peptides are used
      for two purposes: to estimate statistical confidence measures
      such as the false discovery rate, and to train machine learning
      methods to recognize correctly identified spectra.</li>

    <li><b>modification</b>: A chemical modification of a single amino
      acid, typically corresponding to the addition of a molecular
      group to the amino acid side chain.</li>
    
    <li><b>n-term peptide</b>: The first peptide in the protein,
      occurring at the n-terminal end of the protein.</li>
    
    <li><b>peptide</b>: A subsequence of a protein.</li>
    
    <li><b>peptide-spectrum match (PSM)</b>: An observed spectrum
      paired with a peptide sequence, along with a score quantifying
      the quality of the match.</li>

    <li><b>static modification</b>: A chemical modification of a
      single amino that is expected to occur on every instance of that
      amino acid.  A common example is carbamidomethylation of
      cysteine, which adds 57.02146 Da to the mass of every
      cysteine.</li>

    <li><b>target peptide</b>: A real peptide, usually drawn from a
      protein database.</li>

    <li><b>trypsin</b>: An enzyme used to cleave a protein into
      peptides.</li>
    
    <li><b>variable modification</b>: A chemical modification of a
      single amino that is expected to occur on some instances of that
      amino acid but not others.  A common example is phosphorylation
      of serine, threonine or tyrosine, which adds a mass of 79.966331
      Da to each of those amino acids.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Analysis terminology</h2>

  <ul>

  <li><b>false discovery rate (FDR)</b>: Estimated proportion of
    incorrectly identifications among a set of PSMs, peptides or
    proteins.</li>

  <li><b>support vector machine (SVM)</b>: A machine learning method
    that learns to classify data objects into two groups.</li>

  </ul>
