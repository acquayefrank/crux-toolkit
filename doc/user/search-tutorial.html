<h1>Running a Simple Search</h1>

<p> Now that you have your environment <a
href="start-tutorial.html">set up</a> and the two input files 
in your working directory, you can conduct the search. The search
process compares each spectrum in <span class=file>demo.ms2</span> to
peptides (subsequences of the proteins) in <span
class=file>small-yeast.fasta</span>.  For each peptide a theoretical
spectrum is created based on the predicted fragmentation of the
peptide.  The theoretical spectra are each compared to the
experimental spectrum (in the ms2 file) and scored based on their
similarity.  These scores are reported in the output.  To conduct the
search, use this command. </p>

<div class=code>
<code>$ crux search-for-matches demo.ms2 small-yeast.fasta</code>
</div>

<p>While the search is running, you will see output like this
</p>

<pre>
INFO: Reading in ms2 file demo.ms2
INFO: Preparing protein fasta file small-yeast.fasta
INFO: Using amino acid alphabet (ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYBUXZ).
INFO: Searching spectra
</pre>

<p>When the search has completed, it will print</p>
<pre>
INFO: crux-search-for-matches finished
</pre>

<p>A new directory, <span class=file>crux-output</span>, will have been created. 
Looking at the contents of the directory, you will see seven new files.
 containing the search results: 
The file
<span class=file>demo.csm</span> containes the search results in a binary format that 
can be read by 
<span class=prog>crux percolator</span> 
or 
<span class=prog>crux compute-q-values</span>. 
The files 
<span class=file>search.target.sqt</span>
and 
<span class=file>search.target.txt</span>
contain the search results in human readable plain text formats.
<span class=file>search.target.sqt</span> uses the standard
SQT format for spectrum-peptide matches,
and
<span class=file>search.target.txt</span>
uses tab-delmited fields.
The remaining files,
<span class=file>decoy.sqt, decoy.txt, demo-decoy-1.csm, demo-decoy-2.csm</span>
contain the results of searching a shuffled version of the protein database.
</p>

<p>The final step is to analyze our search results.  Each spectrum has
been compared to many peptides and we would like to return only the
best match(es) for each spectrum.  We also expect that
some fraction of the spectra will not be identifiable as peptides (due
to chemical noise, multiple peptides co-eluting, poor fragmentation,
etc.).  The analysis step filters out those spectra and returns only the
high-quality peptide-spectrum matches.  Run this command.
</p>

<div class=code><code>
$ crux percolator small-yeast.fasta </code>
</div>

<p>While the analysis is running, you will see output like this
</p>

<pre>
INFO: Running percolator
INFO: Getting PSMs from ./demo.csm
INFO: Getting PSMs from ./demo-decoy-1.csm
INFO: Getting PSMs from ./demo-decoy-2.csm
INFO: Outputting matches.
</pre>

<p>When the analysis is complete it will print </p>
<pre>
INFO: crux percolator finished.
</pre>

<p>There is new file called <span class=file>target.sqt</span>
containing the results.  The beginning of the file looks like this

<p>This file follows the SQT file format described <a
href="http://fields.scripps.edu/sequest/SQTFormat.html">here</a>, with
a few modifications. Lines beginning with <span class=out>H</span> are
header lines and contain general information about the run.  Lines
beginning with <span class=out>S</span> contain information about a
spectrum including scan number (for the first example <span
class=out>10</span>), charge (<span class=out>2</span>), two
place-holders, the measured m/z of the precursor ion (<span
class=out>636.34</span>), two place holders, and the number of
peptides in the database that were compared to this spectrum (<span
class=out>2)</span>. 

<p>Lines beginning
with <span class=out>M</span> give information about the
peptide-spectrum match including the rank of the primary scoring
function (<span class=out>1</span>), rank of the secondary scoring
function (<span class=out>1</span>), calculated mass of the charged
peptide (<span class=out>1270.49</span>), the relative difference
between the previous score and this one (delta Cn, always 0 for the
best match), the primary score (here, the percolator score, <span
class=out>-1.19</span>), secondary score (here the q-value calculated 
by percolator, <span class=out>0.81</span>), number of 
ions matched  (<span class=out>7</span>), total number of ions
predicted (<span class=out>22</span>), and the sequence of the 
peptide in the context of the protein (<span
class=out>K.SGLIVEIQGVQK.E</span>, the matched peptide is the sequence
between the dots, the flanking residues are also shown.), and the
manual validation code (<span class=out>U</span> for unvalidated).

<p>Lines beginning with <span class=out>L</span>  give the name
of the protein locus for this peptide.  If a peptide is found in more
than one protein, it can be followed by multiple lines.  

<p>The pattern of <span class=out>S, M, L</span> lines repeats for
every spectrum searched.  In this example, there is only one <span
class=out>M</span> line reported for each spectrum, but it is possible to
report more.  See the <a
href="customize-tutorial.html#">customization</a> page for information
about options. 

<!-- we should say something about the default behavior of -->
<!-- analyze-matches being percolator.  Also, the S lines should -->
<!-- report a charged mass calculated from m/z and there should be a U -->
<!-- at the end of the M lines.  L lines should have descriptions -->
