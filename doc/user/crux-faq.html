<h1 align=center>Crux Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<ol>

<li>
<b>How does Crux differ from SEQUEST?</b></li>

<p>
SEQUEST has split into at least four different development threads:
(1) the version developed in the Yates lab, initially at the
University of Washington and later at Scripps, (2) the version mainted
by Thermo Scientific, (3) the version mainted by Sage-N, and (4) the
version maintained in the MacCoss lab at the University of Washington.
Crux is based on the Yates lab development thread, SEQUEST version 28,
whose last documented modification is dated 8/16/99.</p>

<p>
The Crux command <code>sequest-search</code> is an imperfect
reimplementation of SEQUEST 28.  The imperfection arose because, to
avoid copyright infringement, Crux was reverse engineered from the
SEQUEST binary; i.e., the Crux developers did not have access to the
SEQUEST source code.  The reverse engineering continued until the
developers deemed the remaining differences to be of negligible
importance.  A quantitative comparison of the scores computed by Crux
and SEQUEST can be seen in
the <a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/park2008rapid.html">original
Crux paper</a>.  The differences between Crux and SEQUEST v28 are
comparable in magnitude to the differences between different versions
of SEQUEST.</p>

<li>
<b>How does Crux compute the masses of peptides and peptide
  fragments?</b></li>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
Each amino acid can be characterized either by its monoisotopic mass,
which is the mass of the most common isotopic form of that amino acid,
or the average mass, which is a weighted average of the masses of all
the isotopic forms.  By default, Crux uses average mass to calculate
peptide masses, though this can be controlled by the
<code>--isotopic-mass</code> option to <code>crux create-index</code>.
For fragments, Crux always uses the monoisotopic mass.</li>

<li>
The neutral mass of a peptide is not the sum of the masses of its
amino acids.  The C-terminus (i.e., the suffix, or y-ion) of the
peptide has an additional water group, whose mass is either
18.010564684 Da (monoisotopic) or 18.0153 Da (average).  Note that,
for cleavage ions, this additional mass should be added to the mass of
a y-ion, but not to a b-ion.</li>

<li>
By default, Crux adds a static modification of 57.021464 Da to all
cysteines.  This is because in most protein preparation protocols
the peptides are alkylated with iodoacetamise, resulting in 
carbidomethylation of cysteine. The alkylation step prevents the 
reformation of disulfide bonds.  Other alykylation reagents may be
used, in which case the appropriate mass shift can be specified with the
<code>C=[mass]</code> option.  Set <code>C=0</code> for no
modification.
</li>

<li>
A charged peptide has an additional approximately 1 Da mass for each
charge, corresponding to the mass of a hydrogen atom.  The exact mass
to be added depend on whether we are using the monoisotopic mass
(1.0078246) or average mass (1.00794).</li>

</ul>
</p>

<li>
<b>What operating systems does Crux work with?</b></li>

<p>
Crux is written in C++, so in principle it should work on virtually
any modern operating system.  We provide pre-compiled binaries for
Linux, MacOS and Windows.  The latter requires that you have Cygwin
installed.</p>

<li>
<b>How does Crux select candidate peptides from the database?</b></li>

<li>
<b>How is the theoretical spectrum for a peptide generated?</b></li>

<li>
<b>In the calculation of XCorr, what preprocessing steps does the
observed spectrum undergo prior to comparison with the theoretical
spectrum?</b></li>

<li>
<b>What enhancements to Crux are planned?</b></li>

<p>
Crux is under constant development, so the following list of
enhancements may be out of date.  As of November, 2010, the list
includes the following:</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
Support for more input file types.</li>

<li>
The ability to produce XML outputs.</li>

<li>
The ability to exploit accurate precursor masses.</li>

<li>
The ability to compute peptide-level q-values
via <code>compute-q-values</code>, <code>percolator</code>
or <code>q-ranker</code>.</li>

<li>
Support for searching for post-translational modifications in Tide
and <code>search-for-xlinks</code>.</li>

<li>
Tools to do protein-level inference, including identification and
spectral counting.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<li>
<b>How can I contribute to Crux?</b></li>

<p>
Please email crux-support@uw.edu to obtain read-only access to our
Subversion repository, along with access to our development team web
pages.  Patches implementing new features can then be emailed to the
development team for review and inclusion in subsequent releases of
Crux.</p>

<li>
<b>Where does the name "Crux" come from?</b></li>

<p>
Thin air.  The name is not an acronym or a reference to anything in
particular.</p>
