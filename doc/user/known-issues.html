<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Known Issues</H1>
<H2>Version 1.38</H2> July 19th, 2012
  <ol>
  <li>
    Q-Ranker and Barista detect decoy PSMs by use of the <code>--decoy-prefix</code> string (ex. rand_) 
    which is appended to the beginning of the peptide's protein ids. Currently, running the 
	<code>search-for-matches</code> command with a <a href="sample.fasta">fasta file</a>
     generates protein ids from decoy PSMs without the "rand_" prefix.  This issue will cause the 
	following error for QRanker and Barista:</br>
    <pre>
    FATAL: Cannot compute PEP without target or decoy scores.</pre>
    To prevent the error, run the search-for-matches with an 
    <a href="index-tutorial.html">index</a>. </li>
  <li>
    The <code>create-index</code> command will fail when running on Cygwin.
    Crux will successfully create the index in a temporary directory
    but will report an error when it tries to rename the temporary directory:
    <pre>
      WARNING: Cannot rename directory
      FATAL: Failed to create index
    </pre>
    The temporary directory will be named <code>crux_XXXX</code>
    where <code>XXXX</code> will consist of sequence of arbitrary letters and numbers.
    You can recover from the error by renaming the index directory manually.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>create-index</code> command may fail when running on Cygwin.
    Cygwin does not allow users to adjust the maximum allowed number of 
    simultaneously open files.
    When the Crux reaches the open file limit,
    indexing will halt with the following message.
    <pre>
      WARNING: cannot open all file handlers needed
      FATAL: Could not open file handle for index 746.
    </pre>
    You can still run <code>search-for-matches</code> directly on the fasta file,
    but this is significantly slower than a search using an index.
  </li>
  </ol>
