<h1 align=center>Crux Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<ol>

<li>
<b>How does Crux compute the masses of peptides and peptide
  fragments?</b></li>

<ul>

<li>
Each amino acid can be characterized either by its monoisotopic mass,
which is the mass of the most common isotopic form of that amino acid,
or the average mass, which is a weighted average of the masses of all
the isotopic forms.  By default, Crux uses average mass to calculate
peptide masses, though this can be controlled by the
<code>--isotopic-mass</code> option to <code>crux create-index</code>.
For fragments, Crux always uses the monoisotopic mass.</li>

<li>
The neutral mass of a peptide is not the sum of the masses of its
amino acids.  The C-terminus (i.e., the suffix) of the peptide has an
additional water group, whose mass is either 18.010564684 Da
(monoisotopic) or 18.0153 Da (average).</li>

<li>
By default, Crux adds a static modification of 57.021464 Da to all
cysteines.  This is because in most protein preparation protocols
the peptides are alkylated with iodoacetamise, resulting in 
carbidomethylation of cysteine. The alkylation step prevents the 
reformation of disulfide bonds.  Other alykylation reagents may be
used, in which case the appropriate mass shift can be specified with the
<code>C=[mass]</code> option.  Set <code>C=0</code> for no
modification.
</li>

<li>
A charged peptide has an additional approximately 1 Da mass for each
charge, corresponding to the mass of a hydrogen atom.  The exact mass
to be added depend on whether we are using the monoisotopic mass
(1.0078246) or average mass (1.00794).</li>

</ul>
