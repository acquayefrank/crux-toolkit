<center><h1>Txt file format</h1></center>
<p>
The txt file format records the matches between MS/MS spectra
and a sequence database using lines of tab delimited fields.
</p>
<p>
A txt file consists of a single line containing the names of fields separated by tabs,
followed by one or more lines giving the field values separated by tabs.
</p>
<p>
A sample txt file may be found <a href="search.target.txt">here</a>.

<h2>List of fields</h2>
<ol>
<li>scan: The identifying number of each scan.</li>
<li>charge: The charge state for this spectrum in this PSM.</li>
<li>spectrum precursor m/z: The observed m/z of the spectrum precursor ion.</li>
<li>spectrum neutral mass: The computed mass of the spectrum precursor at the
  given charge state. This is equal to the precursor m/z minus the
  mass of a proton (1.00727646677 Da), all multiplied by the charge. </li>
<li>peptide mass: The mass of the peptide sequence, computed as the
  sum of the the amino acid masses plus the mass of water
  (18.010564684 Da or 18.0153 Da, depending on whether we are using
  monoisotopic or average mass).</li>
<li>delta_cn: The normalized difference in xcorr for this PSM relative
  to other PSMs for this spectrum at this charge state.</li>
<li>sp score: The SEQUEST-type preliminary score.</li>
<li>sp rank: The rank of this PSM when sorted by sp score.</li>
<li>xcorr score: The SEQUEST-type cross correlation score.</li>
<li>xcorr rank: The rank of this PSM when sorted by xcorr.</li>
<li>p-value: The p-value computed from the estimated Weibull parameters of
  the score distribution for this spectrum.</li>
<li>Weibull est. q-value: The q-value computed from the p-value.</li>
<li>decoy q-value (xcorr): The empirical q-value computed by ranking
  target and decoy PSMs for this spectrum by xcorr.</li>
<li>percolator score: The discriminant score assigned by percolator.</li>
<li>percolator rank: The rank of this PSM when sorted by percolator score.</li>
<li>percolator q-value: The q-value assigned by percolator.</li>
<li>q-ranker score: The discriminant score assigned by q-ranker.</li>
<li>q-ranker q-value: The q-value assigned by q-ranker.</li>
<li>q-ranker PEP:  The posterior error probability estimated from the q-ranker
  score.</li>
<li>b/y ions matched: The number of b-ions and y-ions in the peptide
  that have a corresponding peak in the spectrum.</li>
<li>b/y ions total: The total number of b- and y-ions predicted for
  this peptide.</li>
<li>matches/spectrum: The number of candidate peptides in the database
  found for this spectrum.</li>
<li>sequence: The peptide sequence.</li>
<li>cleavage type: The cleavage rules for generating this peptide
  based on the user-specified enzyme specificity.</li>
<li>protein id: A comma-separated list of proteins in which this
  peptide appears.  Following the protein name is a number in
  parentheses giving the start position of the peptide in the protein.</li>
<li>flanking aa: The amino acids that precede and follow this peptide
  in the parent protein id.</li>
<li>unshuffled sequence: The target sequence from which a decoy was
  generated.</li>
<li>eta: Estimated Weibull scale parameter.</li>
<li>beta: Estimated Weibull shape parameter.</li>
<li>shift: Estimated Weibull shift parameter.</li>
<li>corr: The correlation of the scores with the estimated Weibull
  distribution.</li>
