<B>Description:</B>

<blockquote>
<p>
This command searches a protein database with a set of spectra.  For
each spectrum, the precursor mass is computed from the measured
precursor m/z and a specified charge.  Candidates molecules are linear
peptides, dead-end products, self-loop products or cross-linked
products whose mass lies within a specified range of the precursor
mass.  These candidate peptides are ranked using XCorr.  The input
protein database is in FASTA format.</p>

<p>
The algorithm is described in more detail in the following article:</p>

<p>
<b>Modifications:</b> Currently, <code>crux search-for-xlinks</code>
supports static modifications (a change of mass applied to a given
amino acid in every peptide in which it occurs) but not variable
modifications (allowing peptides to be generated with and without a
mass change to a given amino acid).  By default, a static modification
of +57 da to cystine (C) is applied.  Static modifications can be
specified in the parameter file, as described below.</p>

</code> &ndash; 
Enzyme to use for <i>in silico</i> digestion of protein sequences. Used
in conjunction with the options digestion and missed-cleavages. Use
'no-enzyme' for non-specific digestion.  Digestion rules are as
follows: enzyme name [cuts after one of these residues]|{but not before
one of these residues}.  trypsin [RK]|{P}, elastase [ALIV]|{P},
chymotrypsin [FWY]|{P}, clostripain [R]|[], cyanogen-bromide [M]|[],
iodosobenzoate [W]|[], proline-endopeptidase [P]|[], staph-protease
[E]|[], modified-chymotrypsin [FWYL]|{P},
elastase-trypsin-chymotrypsin [ALIVKRWFY]|{P},aspn []|[D] (cuts before

cleavage site and the second list is residues after the cleavage site.  
If the residues are required for digestion, they are in square
brackets, '[' and ']'.  If the residues prevent digestion, then they
are enclosed in curly braces, '{' and '}'.  Use X to indicate all
residues.  For example, trypsin cuts after R or K but not before P

peptides both with and without the mass change.  Default C=57.0214637206.

<B>Frequently asked questions:</B>

<blockquote>
<b>What could cause a high q-value even when the PSM gets a high
XCorr?</b><br>

<p>
For some spectra, even randomly generated peptides can get relatively
high XCorr scores.  This is what the empirical curve fitting is
supposed to control for.  The idea is that a high XCorr for one
spectrum means something different than the same XCorr for another
spectrum. Using the curve fit and calculating a p-value for the top
ranked PSM helps to control for the spectrum-specific effects.  As
long the assumption that the distribution of XCorr scores for a
particular spectrum follows a Weibull distribution, then a small
q-value will be statistically significant.</p>

<p>
<b>What happens if you decrease the size of the precursor window?</b></p>

<p>
Reducing the precursor mass tolerance has two main benefits.  One is
reduced search time, and the other is improved statistical power to
detect matches.  With a smaller window, fewer candidates are tested
against a spectrum, which in turn means fewer tests.  As a result, the
statistical confidence measure calculated after multiple testing
correction will be more significant.  Of course, the flipside is that
if you make the precursor window too small, then you may end up
throwing out correct identifications.  Control over the size of the
window is provided by the using the <code>precursor-window</code> and
<code>precursor-window-type</code> options.</p>

<p>
In order for the p-value to be accurately estimated, you may need many
data points for fitting the Weibull distribution.  To achieve an
accurate estimate, this program generates decoy peptides until it
obtains <code>min-weibull-points</code> XCorr scores (default 4000).
The decoys are generated by shuffling target peptides from the
database using a larger precursor window. The window size for the
decoys is obtained from the <code>precursor-window-decoy</code>
and <code>precursor-window-type-decoy</code> parameters.</p>
