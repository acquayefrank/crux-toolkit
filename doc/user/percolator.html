<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Using Crux with Percolator</H1>

<p>
Percolator is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that dynamically
learns to separate target from decoy PSMs.  The algorithm is described
in this article:</p>

Percolator source code and binaries can be downloaded
<a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/percolator/">here</a>.</p>

<p>
Percolator requires as input two collections of PSMs, one set derived
from matching observed spectra against real ("target") peptides, and
a second derived from matching against "decoy" peptides.  Crux generates
these decoys on the fly

<p>
Early versions of Crux (versions 1.XX and 1.05) were capable of
interacting directly with Percolator.  This functionality is no longer
supported.</p>
