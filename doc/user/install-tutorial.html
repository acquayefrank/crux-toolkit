<h3>Crux Installation Instructions</h3>
<p> I will hold off on writing installation instructions until we have
a better idea of how everything will be packaged.   ...with the
exception of the information on $PATH which is referred to by the
start page. Assume the instructions installed all executables in <span
class="code"><em>install-dir</em></span>. 
</p>

<a name="path"></a>
<h4>Changing $PATH</h4>
<p>You can always run any of the programs by specifying its full
path.  For example,</p>

<div class=code><code>
$ <em>install-dir</em>/crux-search-for-matches</code>
</div>

<p>In this final step of the installation, we'll set things up so that
you can also run any of the programs by just typing its name.  This is
done with an environment variable called <span
class=code>$PATH</span>.  <span class=code>$PATH</span> is a list of
places that the computer looks for executable programs.  Find out what
is in the current list with this command.</p>

<div class=code><code>
$ echo $PATH</code><br>
</div>
<p>The value returned might look something like this
<code>
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games
</code>
<p>The first directory in this colon-separated list, <span
class=out>/usr/local/bin</span>, is the first place the computer looks
for a program.  If it doesn't find the program there it tries <span
class=out>/usr/bin</span> and so on down the list.  We will add <span
class=code><em>install-dir</em></span> to the list with this
command.  (Remember to replace the word <em>install-dir</em> with the
actual location of your installation)</p> 

<div class=code><code>
$ export PATH=$PATH:install-dir</code>
</div>

<p>Try '<span class=code>echo $PATH</span>' again to see that the
change was made.  <em>install-dir</em> should be at the end of the
list.  Now you can 
run the <span class=prog>crux</span> programs by just typing their
names.  Try this.</p>

<div class=code><code>
$ crux-search-for-matches</code>
</div>

<p>The change to <span class=code>$PATH</span> is only temporary.  As
soon as you close the window, the change will disappear.  In order to
make the change every time you log on, add the line <span
class=code>export PATH=$PATH:install-dir</span> to the file <span
class=out>.bashrc</span> located in your home directory.  You will
have to log on again for the change to take effect.
