<B>Description:</B></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Given a collection of scored PSMs, estimate q-values.  The q-value is
a statistical confidence measure that is analogous to a p-value but
that incorporates multiple testing.  The q-value associated with a
score threshold T is defined as the minimal false discovery rate at
which a score of T is deemed significant.  In this setting, the
q-value accounts for the fact that we are analyzing a large collection
of spectra.</p>

<p>
<code>Compute-q-values</code> requires that 
<code>search-for-matches</code> produced decoy PSMs or that it
computed p-values.  Up to three different types of q-values may be
computed, depending on how <code>search-for-matches</code> was
executed.  Each of the three types of q-value calculation is based
upon a different method for calculating the false discovery rate, as
follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>
If the collection of PSMs has p-values assigned
by <code>search-for-matches</code> by using the  
<code>--compute-p-values</code> option, then the false discovery rate
associated with a given score is computed using the standard
Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm (<i>Journal of the Royal Statistical
Society B</i>, 57:289-300, 1995).  Briefly, the algorithm is as
follows: (1) rank all <i>m</i> PSMs by p-value; (2) for a
p-value <i>p<sub>j</sub></i> that appears at position <i>j</i> in the
ranked list, the FDR is estimated as <i>p<sub>j</sub> *
(m/j)</i>.</li>

<li>
If the collection of PSMs contains both targets and decoys, then the
false discovery rate associated with a given xcorr score is estimated
as the number of decoy scores above the threshold divided by the
number of target scores above the threshold, multiplied by the ratio
of the total number of targets to total number of decoys.</li>

<li>
If the collection has decoys and p-values, then a third false
discovery rate estimate is computed using the decoys, but the ranking
is based on p-values instead of xcorr.</li>

</ol>

<p>
In each case, the estimated FDRs are converted to q-values by ranking
the PSMs by score and then taking, for each PSM, 
the minimum of the current FDR and all of the FDRs below it in the
ranked list.  The three types of q-values are reported, respectively,
in columns with headers "Weibull est. q-value," "decoy q-value
(xcorr)" and "decoy q-value (p-value)".</p>

<p>
Additional background information on q-values and statistical
confidence measures can be found in this article:</p>

<p>
Note that compute-q-values does not (yet) estimate the percentage of
incorrect targets, as described in the above article.  Hence, the
method implemented here as "decoy q-values" is analogous to the
"Simple FDR" procedure shown in Figure 4A of the above article.</p>

<B>Input:</B></p>

<UL>

<LI>
&lt;protein input &gt; &ndash; 
The name of the file in fasta format or the directory containing the
protein index from which to retrieve proteins and peptides.</li>

<li>
&lt;psm folder&gt; [optional] &ndash; 
A folder in which all the PSM result files are located.  This is 
assumed to be <code>crux-output</code>, but it can be set by the user 
using the <code>--output-dir</code> option. The program looks for 
files with names like '<code>&lt;fileroot&gt;.search.target.txt</code>'
or '<code>&lt;fileroot&gt;.search.decoy.txt</code>', which are produced by 
<code>crux&nbsp;search-for-matches</code>.  All such files in the
given directory are analyzed jointly.</li>

</UL>

<B>Output:</B>

<UL>
<p>
The program writes files to the folder <code>crux-output</code> by default.
The name of the output folder can be set by the user using the <code>--output-dir</code> option.
The following files will be created:</p>

<li>
<b>qvalues.target.txt</b>: a tab-delimited text file containing the PSMs.
See <a href="txt-format.html">txt file format</a> for a list of the fields.</li>
<li>
<b>qvalues.log.txt</b>: a log file containing a copy of all messages that were
printed to stderr.
</li>
<li>
<b>qvalues.params.txt</b>:
a file containing the name and value of all parameters/options for the
current operation. 
Not all parameters in the file may have been used in the operation.  
The resulting file can be used with the <code>--parameter-file</code>
option for other crux programs.
</li>

</ul>

<B>Options:</B>

<UL>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-output.</li>

<li>
<code>--overwrite &lt;T|F&gt;</code> &ndash;
Replace existing files if true (T) or fail when trying to overwrite a
file if false (F). Default =  F.

<li>
<code>--parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
A file containing command-line or additional parameters.  See the <a
href=parameter-file.html>parameter documentation</a> page for details.</li>

<LI>
<code>--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;</code> &ndash; 
Specify the verbosity of the current processes. Each level prints the
following messages, including all those at lower verbosity levels:
0-fatal errors, 10-non-fatal errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on
the progress of execution, 40-more progress information, 50-debug
info, 60-detailed debug info. Default = 30.

<li>
<code>--version T</code> &ndash;
Print the version number and quit.  Please note that you must include
the 'T' after --version.
