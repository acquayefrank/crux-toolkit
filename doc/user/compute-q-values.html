<p>
<B>Description:</B></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Given a collection of scored PSMs, estimate q-values.  The q-value is
a statistical confidence measure that is analogous to a p-value but
that incorporates multiple testing.  The q-value associated with a
score threshold T is defined as the minimal false discovery rate at
which a score of T is deemed significant.  In this setting, the
q-value accounts for the fact that we are analyzing a large collection
of spectra.</p>

<p>
<code>Compute-q-values</code> requires that 
<code>search-for-matches</code> produced decoy PSMs and/or that it
computed p-values.  Up to three different q-values may be computed
depending on how <code>search-for-matches</code> was executed.  

<ol>
<li>
If the collection of PSMs has p-values assigned
by <code>search-for-matches</code> by using the  
<code>--compute-p-values</code> option, then the false discovery
rate associated with a given score is computed using the Benjamini
Hochberg algorithm.  These scores are under the column heading
'Weibull est. q-value'. 

<li>
If the collection of PSMs contains both targets and decoys, then the
false discovery rate associated with a given xcorr score is estimated
as the number of decoy scores above the threshold divided by the number of 
target scores above the threshold. These scores are under the column
heading 'decoy q-value (xcorr)'.</p>

<li>
If the collection has decoys and p-values, then the false discovery
rate is computed as above but the ranking is based on the p-values
instead of xcorr.  These scores are under the column heading 'decoy
q-value (p-value)'. 
</ol>

confidence measures can be found in this article:</p>

<p>
<B>Input:</B></p>

<UL>

<li>
&lt;psm folder&gt; &ndash; A the folder in which all the PSM
result files are located.  This is assumed to be <code>crux-output</code>,
but it can be set by the user using the <code>--output-dir</code> option.
The program looks for files ending in
<code>.csm</code>, which are produced by
<code>crux&nbsp;search-for-matches</code>.  All such files in the
given directory are analyzed jointly.</li>


<LI>
&lt;protein input &gt; &ndash; The name of the file in fasta format or
the directory containing the protein index from which to retrieve
proteins and peptides.</li>

</UL>

<B>Output:</B>

<UL>
<p>
The program writes files to the folder <code>crux-output</code> by default.
The name of the output folder can be set by the user using the <code>--output-dir</code> option.
The following files will be created:</p>

<li>
<b>qvalues.target.txt</b>: a tab-delimited text file containing the PSMs.
</li>
See <a href="txt-format.html">txt file format</a> for a list of the fields.
<li>
<b>qvalues.log.txt</b>: a log file containing a copy of all messages that were
printed to stderr.
</li>
<li>
<b>qvalues.params.txt</b>:
a file containing the name and value of all parameters/options for the
current operation. 
Not all parameters in the file may have been used in the operation.  
The resulting file can be used with the <code>--parameter-file</code>
option for other crux programs.
</li>

</ul>

<B>Options:</B>

<UL>

<li>
<code>--fileroot &lt;string&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The <code>fileroot</code> string will be added as a prefix to all
output file names. Default = none.</li>

<li>
<code>--output-dir &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
The name of the directory where output files will be created.
Default = crux-out.</li>

<li>
<code>--overwrite &lt;T|F&gt;</code> Replace existing files if true (T) or
fail when trying to overwrite a file if false (F). Default =  F.

<li>
<code>--parameter-file &lt;filename&gt;</code> &ndash; 
A file containing command-line or additional parameters.  See the <a
href=parameter-file.html>parameter documentation</a> page for details.</li>

<LI>
<code>--verbosity &lt;0-100&gt;</code> &ndash; Specify the verbosity of the
current processes. Each level prints the following messages, including
all those at lower verbosity levels: 0-fatal errors, 10-non-fatal
errors, 20-warnings, 30-information on the progress of execution,
40-more progress information, 50-debug info, 60-detailed debug info.
Default = 30.

<li>
<code>--version T</code> &ndash;
Print the version number and quit.  Please note that you must include
the 'T' after --version.

</UL>
