<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p> This page will talk about setting up your environment and choosing
your input files.  Be sure to have completed the software <a
href="install-tutorial.html">installation</a> first.
</p>

<a name="env"></a>
<h4>Your environment</h4>
<p>For this tutorial, we'll assume you are working in a Linux/Unix
type shell (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> is a good
choice for Windows users) and already know some basic 
commands for changing directories, listing files, and other simple
tasks.  To successfully run the sample commands, you'll need to work from 
a directory for which you have write permission. Anywhere
in your home directory should work.  Create a new directory and
navigate to it.</p> 
<div class=code><code>
$ mkdir crux-demo<br>
$ cd crux-demo</code>
</div>
<p>
We will refer to this directory, <code>'crux-demo'</code>, as the
<em>working directory</em>.</p> 
<p>Next, make sure that the computer knows where to look for the
<span class=prog>crux</span> programs.  Try this command. </p>
<div class=code><code> 
$ which crux-search-for-matches</code>
</div>
<p>
If it returns a single line with a path ending in <span
class=out>crux-search-for-matches</span>, then you are set.  If not,
review the <a href="install-tutorial.html#path">installation instructions</a> on setting your
<span class=code>$PATH</span> environment variable.

</p>

<a name=ms2></a>
<h4>Input file: mass spectra</h4>
<p>Included in the <span class=prog>crux</span> distribution in the
<span class=file>doc/data</span> directory are some 
sample files containing mass spectra.  We will use the <a
href="data/demo.ms2">demo.ms2</a> for this tutorial.  Locate the
file and copy it to the current working directory.
</p>
<p>The beginning of the file looks like this.
</p>
<pre>

194.3 13.7
</pre>
<div class=note><em>NOTE: There are two kinds of optional lines which
may be included for each spectrum.  Lines beginning with </em><span
class=file>I</span><em> are contain information independent of the
charge state. Following a </em> <span class=file>Z</span><em> line may
be one beginning with </em><span class=file>D</span><em> containing
information specific to the above charge state. </em>
</div>

<p>
The first lines beginning with <span class=file>H</span> are the
header lines and contain information about the program that generated
the file, the date it was created, and so on.  The line starting with
<span class=file>S</span> begins the information about the first
spectrum.  Following the <span class=file>S</span> is the scan number
(twice) and the m/z of the precursor ion.  The lines beginning with
<span class=file>Z</span> list the possible charge states of the
spectrum (in this case 2) and the mass of the peptide at that
charge state.  Following the <span class=file>Z</span> lines is the
list of peaks for the spectrum.  The subsequent spectra in the file
repeat this pattern of <span class=file>S</span> line, <span
class=file>Z</span> line(s), and peak list.  <span
class=file>demo.ms2</span> contains 150 spectra.
</p>

<a name="fasta"></a>
<h4>Input file: protein database (fasta file)</h4>
<p>The second input file you will need, also in, is a protein database.  This file is in
fasta format and contains
a list of proteins you expect to find in your sample and their
sequences.  A sample fasta file is also comes with the distribution in
<span class=file>doc/data/</span>. We will use <a
href="data/small-yeast.fasta">small-yeast.fasta</a>.  Copy it to your
current working directory. 
</p>

<p>The beginning of the file looks like this.

<p>Lines beginning with <span class=file>&gt;</span> give the name of
a protein.  The first word is the protein name followed by an optional
description of any length.  The following lines contain the protein
sequence.  Proteins may or may not be separated by blank lines.
<span class=file>small-yeast.fasta</span> contains 56 proteins.
