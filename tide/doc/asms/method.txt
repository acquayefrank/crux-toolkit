Tide is written in standard C++ with standard template
libraries. Timing and profiling experiments during development were
performed on a 2.4GHz Dual Pentium processor with 4GB RAM running
Linux. All code to date is single-threaded. Measurements were also
taken on a 2.33GHz Dual 64-bit Xeon processor with 16GB RAM.

A yeast benchmark data set consisted of 10,000 randomly-selected
spectra derived from an analysis of soluble yeast whole-cell lysate on an
LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer, searched against a 6,298-protein
sequence database of predicted open reading frames from S. cerevisiae.

A worm benchmark data set consisted of 10,000 randomly-selected
spectra from a 24-h MudPIT analysis of C. elegans proteins, searched
against a corresponding 27,499-protein sequence database.
