Computational analysis of mass spectra remains the speed bottleneck in
many proteomics experiments. SEQUEST was the earliest software package
to identify peptides from mass spectra by searching a database of
known peptides. Though still popular, SEQUEST performs slowly. Crux
and TurboSEQUEST have successfully sped up SEQUEST by introducing a
pre-computed index, but the demand for ever-faster
peptide-identification software continues to grow. Tide, introduced
here, is a software program for peptide identification that achieves a
dramatic speedup over Crux, with no significant changes in program
output. The speedup strategies detailed here are mostly algorithmic;
some entail more efficient use of computer system resources. On
tryptic benchmark sets tested, Tide ran approximately 1000 times more
quickly than Crux and SEQUEST.
