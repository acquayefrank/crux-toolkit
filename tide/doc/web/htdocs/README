This directory contains the executables, documentation, and sample data for 
Tide. Tide is a tool for identifying peptides from tandem mass spectra. It is 
an independent reimplementation of the SEQUEST algorithm, which identifies 
peptides by comparing the observed spectra to a catalog of theoretical spectra
derived in silico  from a database of known proteins. The immediate ancestor of
Tide is Crux, but Tide has been completely re-engineered to achieve a
thousandfold improvement in speed while exactly replicating SEQUEST XCorr scores.
