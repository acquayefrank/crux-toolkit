Introduction
	Motivation & Summary
		SEQUEST is popular but slow
		Dramatic speedup
		Algorithmic, architectural & design changes for speed, use of machine resources
		Table -- final
	Related Work
		SEQUEST
		Crux
		TurboSEQUEST
		XCorr speedup


Materials & Methods
	Devel Computer & Final Results Computer
	Language
	Compiler
	Profiler (during development)
	Worm & Yeast Data Sets
	SEQUEST & Crux settings
\item Specify precisely which version of Crux and SEQUEST we compare
  against, and precisely where the spectra come from.



Results
	What is database search?
		SEQUEST's XCorr and Crux (emphasize that \XCorr refers to everything, including binning, preprocessing, etc.)
	Matching Crux's output
	Groundwork for optimizations (Tide v0)
	Tide v.0 data flow & operation
		Spectrum preprocessing & binning
	Source of difference between Crux and Tide.
		(Crux and SEQUEST compared in [CRUX])
	
	Series of Optimizations
		Timing table
		Initial profile
		FROM PAPER
		Fast Allocator
		Compiler

Discussion


Produce final table:
	Cartesian Product:
		SEQUEST, TurboSEQUEST, Crux, Tide
		Worm, Yeast
		Trypsin, Partial, None (Maybe not)
		Mass Window (0.1, 0.5, 1, 3 Daltons)
