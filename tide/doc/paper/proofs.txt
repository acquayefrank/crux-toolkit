specification. Thanks to the editor for the question.

p. C, line 194: Use 1.0005079 Da/charge (adding "/charge") in the units
specification.

p. C, line 205: Remove indentation.

p. C, line 217-218: In equation, replace subscript "r" with a lower-case "\tau".
Note that this letter appears twice in the equation and should be replaced both

the equation. Also, remove extra space in "\tau = -75" below summation.

p. C, line 218: Change "scores" to "score".

p. F, line 464 and 472: "X!Tandem" should not be allowed to break lines. The
term "X!Tandem" occurs in several places in the text and captions. A
non-breaking version of this term should be used everywhere.

p. H, line 556: Change "Figure 2" to "Figure 5".

p. H, line 564-565: Remove paragraph break.

"Da/charge" or "Th" or "Thompsons" as fits the journal's standards. The changes
correspond to those noted below (p. B, line 178 and p. C, line 194).
