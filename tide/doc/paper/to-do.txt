\breview Pages 8--10. Somewhere in here you should have a discussion of
peptides versus proteins and indexing versus linear scan. The original
SEQUEST used a linear scan through a FASTA database, because a file of
tryptic peptides or pointers to tryptic peptides in the FASTA database
would be about as big as the database itself and semitryptic or
nonspecific peptides would be much bigger. Now computer memories are
much larger, so we can fit larger databases or indexes in main memory
(but still not all the nonspecific human peptides of mass 1000â€“3000
Da). For speed the big issue is probably cache hits. Edwards and
Lippert have published two papers in Workshop on Algorithms in
Bioinformatics (WABI) on these issues. The pFind people (Si-Min He,
etc.) have a paper titled ``Speeding up Mass Spectrometry Based Protein
Identification by Peptide and Spectrum Indexing'', but I don't know
where it has appeared. \ereview
