<h1>Crux calibration tests</h1>

<p>
The crux search-for-matches tool can report statistical confidence
measures in the form of p-values.  In this test, we measure the extent
to which these p-values are uniformly distributed for scores drawn
according to the null hypothesis.  We use as a null model scores
generated by searching real spectra against synthetic (shuffled)
protein sequences.  Uniformity of the p-values is visualized by
plotting a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the p-value distribution.  A
perfect QQ will follow the line y=x.  We plot the QQ plot on a log
scale, and include lines corresponding to y=2x and y=0.5x.  Ideally,
the statistic will stay within these boundaries over multiple orders
of magnitude.</p>
