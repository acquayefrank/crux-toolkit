<h1>Crux calibration tests</h1>

<p>
The crux search-for-matches tool can report statistical confidence
measures in the form of p-values.  In this test, we measure the extent
to which these p-values are uniformly distributed for scores drawn
according to the null hypothesis.  We use as a null model scores
generated by searching real spectra against synthetic (shuffled)
protein sequences.  Uniformity of the p-values is visualized by
plotting a histogram and a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the p-value
distribution.  A perfect histogram will be uniform in the interval
[0,1].  A perfect QQ will follow the line y=x.  We plot the QQ plot on
a log scale, and include lines corresponding to y=2x and y=0.5x.
Ideally, the statistic will stay within these boundaries over multiple
orders of magnitude.</p>

N.B. As of 30 November 2012, the calibration test is not working.
Indeed, as far as I can tell, it never worked, even when I initially
created it in August 2010.</p>
