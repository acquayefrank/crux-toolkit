<h1>Crux calibration tests</h1>

<p>
Various crux tools (search-for-matches, compute-q-values, percolator
and q-ranker) report statistical confidence measures in the form of
p-values or q-values.  In this test, we measure the extent to which
these values are uniformly distributed for scores drawn according to
the null hypothesis.  We use as a null model scores generated by
searching real spectra against synthetic (shuffled) protein sequences.
Uniformity of the scores is visualized by plotting a quantile-quantile
(QQ) plot of the statistic (p-value or q-value).  A perfect QQ will
follow the line y=x.  We plot the QQ plot on a log scale, and include
lines corresponding to y=2x and y=0.5x.  Ideally, the statistic will
stay within these boundaries over multiple orders of magnitude.</p>
